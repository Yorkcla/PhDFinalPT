# How does musical tension and release work?


## Musical Tension and Release in Tonal Structures

Here is a short demonstration that illustrates *the musical tension and release* through tonal structures, using the main theme of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 (4th movement). The focus is on how functional progressions generate tension and release, while variations in other musical elements such as timbre, melody, and chord combinations further shape and support this effect.

Before we begin, this short clip from *Copying Beethoven* illustrates how musicians have historically paid close attention to shaping tension and release, especially through structural principles. In this scene, Anna(copyist) comes to assist Beethoven with the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. He initially dismisses her, as he often did with female musicians, but eventually recognises her understanding of the structural elements of his music and how they create tension and release.

Beethoven’s theme in the fourth movement of the Ninth Symphony has a simple chordal structure based on tonic, dominant, and tonic to establish a musical progression, along with several secondary dominant chords, brief passing dominant–tonic motions, and the use of non-chord tones. Beethoven takes this compact functional structure and extends it across the entire movement, using diverse variations and combinations of musical elements.

First, here is the starting point, where the melody is introduced by the cellos and double basses. The theme progresses calmly as a first introduction, yet it still clearly outlines the melody, highlighted by a single anticipation note that creates a subtle forward-moving tension. <button onclick="jumpTo(158)">BassCello</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

Secondly, the viola is added, leading the melody while the bassoon plays a secondary line supported by the basses. The atmosphere remains calm and gentle. <button onclick="jumpTo(196)">ViolaBassoon</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

Next, the texture expands to the full string section with the addition of the violins. The first violin takes the lead, while the viola and cello support with a secondary melodic line. The bassoon still appears, now emphasising certain phrases rather than carrying the full line. The mood becomes brighter and sweeter, marked *dolce*. <button onclick="jumpTo(234)">StringBassoon</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

As the theme progresses further, the full orchestra presents it for the first time. All wind instruments take part, giving the melody a more active and energetic character. It is not yet the climax, but it shows a complete and confident statement of the theme. <button onclick="jumpTo(272)">Orchestra</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

The movement does not rely only on instrumental timbre. One of its most distinctive features is the inclusion of voices. The theme appears with the baritone, accompanied by playful clarinet and oboe lines. This section unfolds like a quartet texture, offering a more sophisticated harmonic flow. <button onclick="jumpTo(414)">BaritonClaOb</button> <button onclick="jumpTo(462)">Choir</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

After these stages, Beethoven introduces a higher-level structural tension before the climax. He moves through relative keys and mixture chords, as seen in the earlier example from Copying Beethoven. This creates a stronger structural buildup of tension, which is then released through the explosive climactic version of the theme. <button onclick="jumpTo(715)">ClimaxTension</button> <button onclick="jumpTo(729)">Climax</button> <button onclick="pauseVideo()">Ⅱ</button>

The important point is that, despite the different variations and musical factors, the tension–release progression ultimately stays rooted in the underlying harmonic structure, as shown in the Ninth Symphony. This structural principle has shaped modern tonal traditions and continues to influence much of today’s popular music that many of us hear every day.

In *Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance with Somebody*, even the first few seconds *(00:12 - 00:30)* clearly present this harmonic tension–release pattern through its musical and artistic elements, whether in the rhythm, the tempo, or her own beautiful vocal expression. This is common in pop music, which often revolves around a simple cycle of four to five chords.

Also, most modern pop music includes lyrics, giving it a narrative that aligns with its musical progression. In musical theatre, as in historical opera arias, this narrative role becomes even more central. Here, tension–release patterns are carefully shaped to heighten emotional impact and to match specific moments in the story.

In *Speechless from Aladdin*, the song expresses Jasmine’s determination to claim her own identity, declaring *“I won’t be silenced.”* This narrative is reinforced by a chordal tension–release progression that aligns with the story, guiding listeners through an emotional arc that mirrors Jasmine’s struggle and eventual empowerment *(00:39 - 01:09)*.

## Tonal Tension and Release in Sonic Interaction Design

The tension–release structures demonstrated above lead us to an important question: how might we apply these principles to auditory interface design in ways that align with users’ workflows and support their cognitive interaction for more effective sonic interaction? In practice, this involves interpreting users’ interaction processes, mapping harmonic tension–release structures onto them in ways that reflect their cognitive flow, and customising musical parameters to shape the intended interaction experience.

<img src="../assets/images/principle.jpg" alt="Design Principle" width="700" height="auto" class="zoomable" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">

The academic basis draws from tonal cognition and interaction design, using the cognitive structures of tonal music to inform auditory interface design for cognitively intuitive interaction. These ideas can be specified through functional harmony and workflow analysis by examining how chord functions generate musical progressions and analysing users’ tasks to specify their detailed steps and integrate them according to users’ cognitive flows. This connection can be applied through Roman numeral analysis and hierarchical task analysis. Roman numeral analysis clarifies harmonic functions and progressions, and hierarchical task analysis provides a structured view of users’ workflows and the relative importance of each phase.

Combining both methods provides a practical means of applying tonal principles to designing communicative auditory interfaces; however, practitioner accessibility remains essential. Even a strong concept becomes ineffective if designers cannot use it in practice. For this reason, we need guidelines together with supporting tools that enable practitioners to translate tonal principles into their designs using plain language, assisted by generative AI applications. As a guideline, the process can be streamlined through task formation, assigning harmonic functions to relevant tasks, and making chord decisions, with optional features for practitioners with musical knowledge. Below is a brief demo showing how this guideline can be implemented in a supporting design tool with generative AI assistance.
