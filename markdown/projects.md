## Journey through Projects

My PhD unfolded through five interconnected projects, each one shaping the next as I moved from conceptual exploration to a complete AI-assisted creativity support tool. Although these projects stand as independent contributions, they form a continuous journey of learning and discovery as I sought to understand how the tonal tension and release support sonic interaction design.

### Project 0: Setting the Foundation

The journey began with a broad question and a curiosity about how tonal music might inform accessible sound design for both designers and end users. In this early phase, I mapped the overall direction of the research, its phases, methods, and intended contributions by identifying three guiding keywords: *progressive*, *explainable*, and *accessible*. These keywords are grounded in tonal music principles and served as a conceptual compass (justification) for the work that followed.

*Progressive* captured the interconnected flow of musical progression, encouraging me to view sound design not as discrete elements but as transitions forming a larger narrative. *Explainable* reflected the clarity of tonal grammar, a reminder that the structure behind tonal tension and release could guide designers through logical hierarchies. *Accessible* represented a commitment to building frameworks and tools that practitioners without formal musical training could actually use in practice. 

This conceptual starting point framed the direction of the PhD and was published as an early milestone at [Creativity and Cognition 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3591196.3596814).

### Project 1: Mapping the Research Landscape

With this foundation in place, I turned to the research landscape to learn how others had engaged with tonal music in sonic interaction design. I conducted a systematic literature review, gathering 199 papers and organising them into thematic groups and categories of musical application. As I worked through these studies, patterns emerged including varying interpretations of tonal principles, differing levels of musical knowledge, and a field still searching for structured ways to use music in design, with much of the work centred on vision and medicine. This phase broadened my understanding of the interdisciplinary terrain and helped identify the gaps my research could address, particularly in taking a more structurally grounded approach to music.

### Project 2: Understanding Practitioner Needs

With a clearer theoretical view, I shifted my attention to practitioners who might engage with musical concepts in their work. Through focus groups, interviews, and thematic analysis, I explored how designers typically work with sound and how they specifically relate to tonal ideas. Because many sound-design practitioners came from diverse backgrounds and had limited musical knowledge, they needed tools that were simple, intuitive, and template-based, yet still logically structured for collaboration. Their design processes often began with concrete physical setups and gradually moved toward applying abstract concepts. To explore these needs, I created an imagined prototype in Figma, and the study using this prototype helped generate the early design sketches for the tool. This study was presented and published at [Audio Mostly 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3678299.3678321).

### Project 3: Translating Concepts into Practice

As the research progressed, I became increasingly interested in how these ideas might function in real design settings. I developed practitioner-based scenarios from the domain contexts identified in the previous project and used them to guide the creation of the first AI-assisted web prototype, built with JavaScript, Tone.js, and the Tonal library. For the first time, the concept of the tonal tension and release moved from concepts into an interactive system that practitioners could directly experience. The prototype supported designers in organising storyboards, assigning sounds aligned with end users’ cognitive flow, and exploring early GenAI applications. This work was presented and published at [OzCHI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726986.3727042).

### Project 4: From Insights to a Design Framework

With both conceptual and practical insights in place, I stepped back to consolidate what the research had become. This led to the development of a formal design framework outlining how the tonal tension and release can be systematically applied in sonic interaction design.Supported by AI-integrated demonstrations, the step-by-step practical guidelines, which were organised into three stages with optional advanced pathways for experienced designers, brought together tonal music theory, interaction design, and practitioner accessibility into a coherent structure. This framework became the theoretical backbone of the PhD and was presented at [CHI 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706599.3720089).

### Project 5: Bringing CadenceFlow to Evaluation

The final stage of the journey brought everything together in CadenceFlow, a complete AI-assisted creativity support tool implemented as a React-based web application. This version of the tool was developed through iterative design, two formative focus groups, and a summative evaluation with 20 participants. Through statistical and thematic analyses, I examined how potential users engaged with the tool, how the tonal tension and release strategy shaped their design decisions, and what they required to support accessibility. This final project brought together the entire trajectory, from the early conceptual questions to a functioning evaluative prototype, and it also reflected on the evolving relationship between humans and AI in creative work, especially regarding agency and ownership.
