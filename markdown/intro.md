# What did the study explore?


## Forming the Focus

This study grew out of my early experiences during my undergraduate and master’s studies, which shaped my interest in sound and interaction. I began performing early in life and was trained through an intuitive yet systematic musical education that valued precision, structure, and engagement with repertoire from a wide range of musical eras. Building on this foundation, I later developed an interest in more analytical approaches, particularly functional harmony, during my bachelor’s studies in music theory.

Later, during my master’s studies, I worked with sound designers and engineers in industry and began to notice a contrasting perspective. Many practitioners approached sound and music as highly abstract or purely aesthetic elements within the design process. While sound is certainly an intangible and multifaceted medium, especially when considered as an art form, this abstract view often lacked the logical and structural understanding I had developed through my musical training. This contrast made me curious about the gap between the detailed and analytical approaches found in music scholarship and the more intuitive ways designers engaged with musical ideas in their creative practice.

I began to consider whether the fundamental tonal structures that shape musical tension and release, often described as tonal cognition, could inform the design of sonic interactions and communications through interfaces. I envisioned that these principles could provide designers with a logical foundation for creating cognitively intuitive and structurally coherent design ideas, rather than relying solely on feeling-based approaches. By offering guidelines grounded in musical grammar, designers could customise their sounds according to specific design intentions while maintaining conceptual clarity and communicable reasoning in both practical and academic contexts.

From this idea, I identified a set of recurring keywords that shaped the foundation of my PhD: musical tension and release, sonic interaction design, and creativity support tools. The research explored how principles of tonal cognition could be applied in sonic interaction design to create auditory interfaces that reflect listeners’ cognitive flow of tension and release. This perspective aimed to help designers incorporate musical principles into their creative practice through a structured framework and design-support tool. These themes collectively informed my research questions and guided the series of projects that followed, which were first outlined during the initial planning stage, *Project 0*.

## Guiding Questions

Building on this background, the PhD raises a broader research question:

- RQ0: **How can musical tension and release inform sonic interaction design through creativity support tools?**

From this central question, three sub-questions emerged, each addressing a different stage of the investigation:

- RQ1: **How can principles of tonal music inform and structure sonic interaction design?**

- RQ2: **How do practitioners approach sonic interaction design and incorporate tonal tension and release in their design?**

- RQ3: **How can creativity support tools help designers apply tonal tension and release in auditory interface design?**

These questions guided the research across five interconnected projects. An initial planning stage, *Project 0*, defined the overall scope and aims. *Projects 1 and 4* addressed the first question through a systematic literature review and the development of a design framework. *Projects 2, 3, and 4* investigated practitioners’ needs and envisioned a prototype and a framework grounded in their design contexts. The final question was examined through *Projects 2, 3, and 5*, which together formed an iterative process of prototype development, implementation, and evaluation, leading to the final creativity support tool. *Project 5*, in particular, addressed a broad research question in a manner similar to *RQ 0*, serving as a final project.

## Summarised Outcomes

I conducted **five projects** and one initial planning project *(Project 0)* that defined the overall structure and direction of the research. Across these projects, I employed a range of methods, including a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews, prototyping, and structured user testing. Data were analysed through thematic anaylsis such as inductive, deductive, semantic, and reflexive approaches, as well as statistical methods including t-tests, ANOVA, and linear mixed models in Python. For prototyping, I used Figma, JavaScript, React, Tone.js with the Tonal library, p5.js, and generative AI APIs including OpenAI and Gemini to develop web-based applications. In total, I produced **three prototypes** along with one simplified demo, conducted **three evaluations**, and wrote **six manuscripts**, **four of which have been published** and two are currently under review. This research journey has allowed me to position interdisciplinary work across sound, music, and computing, to understand the diverse perspectives at their intersection, and to reflect deeply on broader variables of interaction beyond single musical parameters, as well as on AI-assisted approaches that shape creativity and authorship.
