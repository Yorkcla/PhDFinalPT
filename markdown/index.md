# Musical Tension and Release in Sonic Interaction Design: A Framework and Creativity Support Tool

Hi everyone! I’m Minsik Choi, a PhD researcher in sonic interaction design at SMACC Lab, ANU.
I will be presenting my PhD Oral Presentation on **Friday, 28 November, at 10 am in Room 3.41, Building 145**, and everyone is welcome to join 🤠

My research explores how musical principles can guide sound design practitioners in creating more communicative and intutiive sounds. I have developed a creativity support tool that bridges music, design, and AI to make sound design more intuitive and accessible for both designers and end-users.

Join me to see how musical tension and release come to life through interactive sound design 🎵

## Overview

When we listen to music, whether classical or pop, we often experience tension and release through sonic progressions. This occurs because we cognitively follow the flow shaped by tonal structures and musical elements such as pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. While interpreting these effects as a universal design principle may not be culturally comprehensive, tonal music remains deeply familiar in our everyday listening. Understanding tonal cognition, therefore, offers persuasive possibilities for designing intuitive and communicative sonic interactions.

In this presentation, I will share my PhD journey exploring musical tension and release in sonic interaction design through the development of a creativity support tool. I will begin with an overview of the research, outlining its purpose, questions, and methods, along with the five projects that were conducted. Next, I will introduce the design strategy that brings the concept of musical tension and release into sonic interaction design. I will then walk through each project to show how they shaped the overall research process. To conclude, I will reflect on the outcomes across projects and discuss the broader contributions and implications of this work.

My PhD contributes to both academic and practical aspects by applying tonal principles to sonic interaction design through a design framework and a creativity support tool, both supported by multiple evaluations. This work addresses the gap between the closely related yet often disconnected domains of music, sound, and human–computer interaction, bridging them through interdisciplinary theories and methods.
