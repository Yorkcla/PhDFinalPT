## Individual Reflections After Each Project

### The challenge of literature review and understanding disciplinary conventions
I learned that even when a particular method of literature review seems reasonable, it must still begin with a solid understanding of existing conventions such as PRISMA, the clear and acceptable definitions of main objectives, and the framing expectations within each relevant field. Sonification, sonic interaction design, and auditory interfaces and displays overlap in subtle and slightly different ways, which makes it difficult to determine where a study truly belongs or how to position one’s own research and explain why. I also realised that having a clear research question is essential for a systematic literature review.
 
### Multiple research targets and the difficulty of maintaining a coherent flow
Because I tried to cover multiple research targets, the manuscript often became difficult to structure in a coherent and streamlined way. I wanted to understand general workflows as well as how practitioners actually apply musical tension and release in practice. I also learned about presenting processes and results through suitable figures, since different figure types can communicate findings in different ways. Most importantly, the user findings were not what I expected. Many participants who initially claimed to know music eventually demonstrated very limited musical knowledge. I also realised that trying to understand users’ needs in detail, even when they seem trivial or predictable, lays the foundation for achieving higher-quality research in later stages.
 
### Prototype development and realising the need for structured code and logical organisation
From this project, I felt that I understood the HCI research process much more clearly, especially while developing my first prototype. I was able to articulate the overall research aim more effectively and explain the users’ context as an essential background for the study. However, in terms of the prototype itself, I initially wrote code without a strong logical structure or architectural plan, which ultimately made the system less organised. Interestingly, this less structured aspect turned out to be positively engaging for a few users during the later evaluation. Even so, I realised the importance of developing with clearer and more consistent logic, including making intentional decisions about languages and libraries, and being able to justify each technical implementation.
 
### The importance of deciding core terms appropriate to different communities
I had a clear understanding of the concepts, but it was challenging to organise my design strategies logically and articulate them with specific, accessible keywords. Some terms such as functional harmony and tonal cognition represented the concepts accurately in an academic sense, but they were difficult to communicate to an audience in computer science. For this reason, I used musical tension and release instead of tonal cognition, for example. Similarly, explaining methods for organising users’ workflows involved many possible approaches, including hierarchical task analysis, journey maps, and storyboards. I needed to decide which method was most appropriate for each context. In the framework, I relied on hierarchical task analysis, but in the tool features I used lighter concepts such as storyboards or user journeys. I also found it difficult to explain the idea of further customisation beyond the basic tonal structures, such as the advanced options in the framework. These concepts require some musical knowledge, yet removing them entirely would have made the system overly simplified. Communicating this balance in plain language was one of the most challenging aspects.
 
### Growing Insight into HCI and Theory in Creative Practice
I feel fortunate to have maintained consistent progression and publications, which encouraged me to approach the final project with genuine passion. This time, I gained confidence in explaining tonal cognition through simple examples, positioning it more clearly within sonic interaction design, and planning user studies ranging from formative focus groups to summative evaluations with statistics. I also became more specific about technical planning, component design, and API integration across a consistent language stack. Importantly, I realised something fundamental: although artistic practices often rely on intuition, having a theoretical framework increases accessibility for a wider range of people. This reminded me of the crucial role of theory in creative processes. It does not replace intuition, but it enhances broader applications and communication.
 
## Reflective Understandings From the Overall Research
 
### Creative research requires understanding conventions
Research and manuscript writing can be creative, but they must still rest on established conventions and disciplinary expectations. Creativity becomes meaningful when it is grounded in these foundations.
 
### Understanding users reveals genuinely creative next steps
Deep understanding of users, including details that may seem trivial, opens opportunities for unexpected and genuinely creative ideas. Selecting appropriate methods to visualise and explore these ideas is essential.
 
### Development requires not only justification but also clarity and structure
GenAI has made feature development much easier, but understanding why a feature is developed and how it fits into a design rationale is a separate and important layer, especially in HCI. I also learned that writing code requires structural clarity much like writing prose. A logical flow, clean organisation, and a consistent architecture are necessary for both readability and justification.
 
### Communicating concepts and findings is another design problem
Especially in interdisciplinary work, the same concepts must be framed differently depending on the audience. Communicating ideas in clear and persuasive ways becomes as important as the findings themselves.
 
## Research Directions Inspired by These Takeaways
 
Understanding creativity in AI-mediated interactions
What makes people feel creative when working with AI applications? Artistic content such as music-making alone does not automatically constitute creative computing. I want to understand the specific aspects that evoke a sense of creativity, especially when users engage with AI applications.
 
Extending beyond tension and release: other musical factors in interaction
Musical tension and release provide a strong structural foundation, but many other musical factors might meaningfully influence emotions, interaction quality, and overall experience. I want to explore how these factors can be combined to support more effective sonic interaction design, building on the findings from my PhD research.
 
Exploring the role of musical elements in everyday interactions
We listen to music every day, yet musical principles are rarely integrated into everyday interface design. By this, I do not mean musical activities themselves but the underlying principles and processes that guide musical engagement. Conversely, tools for musicians often lack considerations of everyday interaction beyond performance contexts, such as how they engage with music in daily life. I want to explore how musical elements can meaningfully contribute to everyday interfaces and how principles from everyday interaction can enrich musical activitie
