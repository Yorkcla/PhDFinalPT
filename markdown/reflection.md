# What are the takeaways?

## Reflections After Each Project

### Navigating Conventions in an Interdisciplinary Research Landscape
I learned that even when a particular method of literature review seems reasonable, it must still begin with a solid understanding of existing conventions such as PRISMA, the clear and acceptable definitions of main objectives, and the framing expectations within each relevant field. Sonification, sonic interaction design, and auditory interfaces and displays overlap in subtle and slightly different ways, which makes it difficult to determine where a study truly belongs or how to position one’s own research and explain why. I also realised that having a clear research question is essential for a systematic literature review.
 
### Maintaining Coherence and Strengthening Research Through Early User Insight
Because I tried to cover multiple research targets, the manuscript often became difficult to structure in a coherent and streamlined way. I wanted to understand general workflows as well as how practitioners actually apply musical tension and release in practice. I also learned about presenting processes and results through suitable figures, since different figure types can communicate findings in different ways. Most importantly, the user findings were not what I expected. Many participants who initially claimed to know music eventually demonstrated very limited musical knowledge. I also realised that trying to understand users’ needs in detail, even when they seem trivial or predictable, lays the foundation for achieving higher-quality research in later stages.
 
### Early Prototype Development and the Importance of Organised Structure
From this project, I felt that I understood the HCI research process much more clearly, especially while developing my first prototype. I was able to articulate the overall research aim more effectively and explain the users’ context as an essential background for the study. However, in terms of the prototype itself, I initially wrote code without a strong logical structure or architectural plan, which ultimately made the system less organised. Interestingly, this less structured aspect turned out to be positively engaging for a few users during the later evaluation. Even so, I realised the importance of developing with clearer and more consistent logic, including making intentional decisions about languages and libraries, and being able to justify each technical implementation.
 
### Articulating Key Concepts for Different Communities
I had a clear understanding of the concepts, but it was challenging to organise my design strategies logically and articulate them with specific, accessible keywords. Some terms such as functional harmony and tonal cognition represented the concepts accurately in an academic sense, but they were difficult to communicate to an audience in computer science. For this reason, I used musical tension and release instead of tonal cognition, for example. Similarly, explaining methods for organising users’ workflows involved many possible approaches, including hierarchical task analysis, journey maps, and storyboards. I needed to decide which method was most appropriate for each context. In the framework, I relied on hierarchical task analysis, but in the tool features I used lighter concepts such as storyboards or user journeys. I also found it difficult to explain the idea of further customisation beyond the basic tonal structures, such as the advanced options in the framework. These concepts require some musical knowledge, yet removing them entirely would have made the system overly simplified. Communicating this balance in plain language was one of the most challenging aspects.
 
### Deeper Insight Into HCI and Theoretical Thinking in Creative Practice
I feel fortunate to have maintained consistent progression and publications, which encouraged me to approach the final project with genuine passion. This time, I gained confidence in explaining tonal cognition through simple examples, positioning it more clearly within sonic interaction design, and planning user studies ranging from formative focus groups to summative evaluations with statistics. I also became more specific about technical planning, component design, and API integration across a consistent language stack. Importantly, I realised something fundamental: although artistic practices often rely on intuition, having a theoretical framework increases accessibility for a wider range of people. This reminded me of the crucial role of theory in creative processes. It does not replace intuition, but it enhances broader applications and communication.
 
## Overall Insights From the Research
 
***Interdisciplinary research requires understanding conventions and effective delivery***, because even the fresh cross-disciplinary ideas need to be grounded in the established expectations within each field and be communicated in ways that audiences from different backgrounds can easily follow. ***Understanding users reveals creative next steps***, and attention to details that seem trivial often opens unexpected opportunities while guiding how ideas should be explored. ***Development requires justification, clarity, and structure***. GenAI may make feature creation easier, but recognising why a feature matters and how it fits within a design rationale remains central in HCI, and writing code demands logical flow, clean organisation, and consistent architecture in the same way that writing prose does. ***Creative practice contains multiple perspectives***, and the meaning of intuition or artistic sense varies depending on one’s background or level of expertise. A beginner, an expert, someone who sees themselves as experienced but shows a different level of expertise, or an advanced beginner will all perceive artistic intuitiveness differently. Although intuition is fundamental to artistic work, some people cannot reach certain outcomes without theoretical grounding, while others may not perceive something as *artistic* or *creative* even when it is strongly supported by theoretical support. Clarifying the context and standpoint from which target users and artistic ideas are approached therefore becomes essential for persuasive communication.
 
## Directions Emerging From the Takeaways
 
***What enables creativity in AI-mediated interactions?*** I want to understand what actually makes users feel creative or artistic when engaging with AI applications, since artistic content such as music-making alone does not automatically constitute creativity in computing experience. Identifying the specific aspects that evoke creativity is essential for designing tools that genuinely support users’ expression and design ideas while maintaining their sense of agency.

***How might musical principles shape everyday interactions?*** Although music is part of daily life, the principles that structure musical engagement are rarely reflected in everyday interaction design. Likewise, insights from everyday interaction are often overlooked in musical contexts, even though they can support musical activities. I want to investigate how musical elements and their dynamics can meaningfully contribute to everyday interactions, and how ideas from everyday interaction can, in turn, enrich musical activities.
