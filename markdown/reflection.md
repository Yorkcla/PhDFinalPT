## Answering to the Research Questions

### RQ1: How can principles of tonal music inform and structure sonic interaction design?

Tonal music has already been used in various forms within sonic interaction design, and its underlying concepts often appear across different domains even when explicit tonal terminology is not visible. However, to use these principles effectively in research and design practices, it can be helpful to ground them in a clear theoretical understanding and apply them in a structured way. Furthermore, because sonic interaction design is interdisciplinary, tonal concepts need to be articulated in an accessible form so that designers and researchers without a musical background can readily understand and apply them.

### RQ2: How do practitioners approach sonic interaction design and incorporate tonal tension and release in their design?

Sound design involves collaboration among practitioners from different roles and fields, so it cannot be defined only by those who create sounds. Because backgrounds in music and interaction design vary widely, effective communication across different expertise is essential, which requires language that a broad range of users can understand. This interdisciplinary nature also expands the target users of design tools, while the specialised terminology in each domain adds complexity to communication and practical application. Practitioners often begin with concrete and physical setups and gradually move toward more abstract considerations, and although much of their work is intuitive, they are asked to justify their decisions clearly. In sound design that incorporates tonal knowledge, most practitioners lack formal training in music theory unless they have studied music. Therefore, it is important to provide accessible design templates such as presets that can support diverse expertise and practical use.

### RQ3: How can creativity support tools help designers apply tonal tension and release in auditory interface design?

Matching the harmonic functions to the cognitive flow of user interaction can be an effective strategy for auditory interface design, and this strategy can be implemented through supporting tools that improve accessibility and practical use for designers. Generative AI can automate workflow structuring, chord assignment, and chord selection based on harmonic functions, and the tool’s interface should guide and complement these design processes. The tool should provide immersive creative support beyond basic usability and offer additional options for users with stronger musical knowledge. AI-based assistance must balance automated features with manual engagement to support agency and ownership in creativity, and the tool should accommodate diverse preferences and detailed requirements across iterative design processes.

## Reflections after Projects

### Project 1: Understanding Conventions in an Interdisciplinary Research Landscape
I learned that even when a particular method of literature review seems reasonable, it must still begin with a solid understanding of existing conventions such as *PRISMA*, the clear and acceptable definitions of main objectives, and the framing expectations within each relevant field. *Sonification, sonic interaction design, and auditory interfaces and displays* overlap in subtle and slightly different ways, which makes it difficult to determine where my research truly belongs and how to explain its positioning. I also realised that having an explicit research question is essential for a systematic literature review.
 
### Project 2: Maintaining Coherence and Strengthening Research Through Early User Insight
Because I tried to cover multiple research targets, the manuscript often became difficult to structure in a coherent and streamlined way. I wanted to understand general workflows and how practitioners apply musical tension and release, even in complex processes. I also learned about presenting processes and results through suitable figures, since different figure types can communicate findings in different ways. Most importantly, the user findings were not what I expected. Many participants who initially claimed to know music eventually demonstrated very limited musical knowledge. I also realised that trying to understand users’ needs in detail, even when they seem trivial or predictable, lays the foundation for later stages.
 
### Project 3: Early Prototype Development and the Importance of Organised Structure
From this project, I felt that I understood the HCI research process much more clearly, especially while developing my first prototype. I was able to articulate the overall research aim more effectively and explain the users’ contexts as design backgrounds for the study. However, in terms of the prototype itself, I initially wrote the prototype without a strong logical structure or architectural plan, which made the system less organised, though this unstructured aspect later turned out to be positively engaging for a few users during evaluation. Even so, I realised the importance of developing with clearer logic, including creating a concrete development blueprint, choosing languages and libraries, and justifying each technical decision.
 
### Project 4: Articulating Key Concepts for Different Communities
I understood the concepts clearly, but organising my design strategies and expressing them in accessible terms for interdisciplinary audiences and practitioners was challenging. Some terms such as functional harmony and tonal cognition represented the concepts accurately in an academic sense, but they were difficult to communicate to an audience in computer science. For this reason, I used musical tension and release instead of tonal cognition, for example (overly broad, but much more intuitive in plain language). Similarly, explaining methods for organising users’ workflows involved many possible approaches, including task analysis, journey maps, and storyboards. I needed to understand the subtle distinctions between the methods and determine where each would be most effective. In the framework, I relied on hierarchical task analysis (because it organises tasks systematically for easier alignment with chord progressions), but in the tool features I used lighter concepts such as storyboards or user journeys. Explaining customisation beyond basic tonal structures was also difficult, as it requires musical experience to understand how to build on a structural foundation.
 
### Project 5: Balancing Theory and Intuition in Creative Practice
I felt fortunate to have maintained consistent progression, which encouraged me to approach the final project with genuine passion. This time, I gained confidence in explaining tonal cognition through simpler examples, positioning it more clearly within sonic interaction design, and planning user studies ranging from formative focus groups to summative evaluations with statistics. I also became more specific about technical planning, component design, and API integration across a consistent language stack. Importantly, I realised something fundamental: although artistic practices often rely on intuition, having a theoretical framework increases accessibility and strengthens communication. I also came to understand that highly intensive forms of support, such as fully automated AI assistance, do not necessarily enhance the creative experience. This made clear that creative work depends on finding the right balance between rational guidance and intuitive autonomy.
 
## Overall Insights from the Research
 
***Interdisciplinary research requires understanding conventions and effective delivery***, because even the fresh cross-disciplinary ideas need to be grounded in the established expectations within each field and be communicated in ways that audiences from different backgrounds can easily follow. ***Understanding users reveals creative next steps***, and attention to details that seem trivial often opens unexpected opportunities while guiding how ideas should be explored. ***Development requires justification, clarity, and structure***. GenAI may make feature creation easier, but recognising why a feature matters and how it fits within a design rationale remains central in HCI, and writing code demands logical flow, clean organisation, and consistent architecture in the same way that writing prose does. ***Creative practice contains multiple perspectives***, and the meaning of intuition or artistic sense varies depending on one’s background or level of expertise. A beginner, an expert, someone who sees themselves as experienced but shows a different level of expertise, or an advanced beginner will all perceive artistic intuitiveness differently. Although intuition is fundamental to artistic work, some people cannot reach certain outcomes without theoretical grounding, while others may not perceive something as *artistic* or *creative* even when it is strongly supported by theoretical support. Clarifying the context and standpoint from which target users and artistic ideas are approached therefore becomes essential for persuasive communication.
 
## Looking Ahead from the Takeaways
 
***What enables creativity in AI-mediated interactions?*** I want to understand what actually makes users feel creative or artistic when engaging with AI applications, since artistic content such as music-making alone does not automatically constitute creativity in computing experience. Identifying the specific aspects that evoke creativity is essential for designing tools that genuinely support users’ expression and design ideas while maintaining their sense of agency.

***How might musical principles shape everyday interactions?*** Although music is part of daily life, the principles that structure musical engagement are rarely reflected in everyday interaction design. Likewise, insights from everyday interaction are often overlooked in musical contexts, even though they can support musical activities. I want to investigate how musical elements and their dynamics can meaningfully contribute to everyday interactions, and how ideas from everyday interaction can, in turn, enrich musical activities.
